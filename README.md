## Dependencies
Package(s) used in this project have yet to have wheel releases for Windows 
and MacOS ([see issue](https://github.com/OpenNMT/Tokenizer/issues/136)). 
These package(s) are essential for processing the Encoder-Decoder model
inputs and outputs.

Until this is addressed, we recommend either running these notebooks:
* Google Colab
* Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

To install the packages run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
